# Welcome! 

As I continue to learn more every day about different programming languages, I'm going to be using this repository to store all of the notebooks that I have used in various courses to grow/practice, so that it's easy to see what I've learned and how I've applied that knowledge (as well as as a reference for myself, so that I can keep everything fresh!). Have a look around and feel free to reach out if you have any comments or questions.
